## Spark

[Demo](https://demo.sparkscheduler.com) | [Project Details](https://robvanbakel.com/spark)

Spark aims to make it easy for employers to manage their staff, as well as create and share work schedules with their employees. Weekly schedules can be made in the app, which are then being pushed to a calendar feed that employees can subscribe to.

## Scheduler

[Live site](https://avsr.nl) | [Project Details](https://robvanbakel.com/scheduler)

At a former employer, our work schedule was created per week. Every employee got their weekly schedule sent by them via a Slack message by the Planning department. To simplify the lives of my colleagues and myself, I created an easy way to import everybody's work schedules into their phone's calendars.
