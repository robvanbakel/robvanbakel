## Scheduler

[Live site](https://avsr.nl) | [Project Details](https://robvanbakel.com/scheduler)

At a former employer, our work schedule was created per week. Every employee got their weekly schedule sent by them via a Slack message by the Planning department. To simplify the lives of my colleagues and myself, I created an easy way to import everybody's work schedules into their phone's calendars.

## Spark

[Demo](https://demo.sparkscheduler.com)

Spark aims to make it easy for employers to create and share work schedules with their employees. Employees will be notified when their schedule changes and will be prompted to approve the updates before they are automatically added to their phone's calendars.
